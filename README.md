# DQGUI (Data Quality Graphical User Interface)

![](https://herschel.io/assets/dqgui/dqgui-search.png)

**DQGUI** is a Java based IDE written on top of JavaFX for users of the [IQM4HD](https://iqm4hd.wp.hs-hannover.de/english.html) (Intelligent Quality Monitoring for Heterogeneous Data) project. It provides a way to interact with the projects evaluation engine by providing a graphical user interface. This allows users to develop custom components of the IQM4HD domain specific language without the need of setting up the entire IQM4HD infrastructure first. It also allows storing IQM4HD DSL compilation units in a database so multiple users can work remotely on the existing monitoring rules. A remote execution server is also included as some monitoring rules can take a long time to evaluate and the user might want to close DQGUI in the meanwhile.
